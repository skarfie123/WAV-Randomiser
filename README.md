# WAV Randomiser

Provided a folder with images and corresponding audio files, such as yo.gif and yo.wav, the program will randomise the audio and show the 'answer' image when requested.
This was created for learning Japanese characters, but could equally be used for other languages or even UK Road Signs.

To run: python randomiser.py
